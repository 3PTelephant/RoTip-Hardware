# Fabrication of RoTip's Fingertip

There are three main steps in this fabrication process:

1. **3D Printing of Moulds**  
   Using the FormLab Form 3 3D printer i.e., Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing technique to print the moulds. 
   The created shell with clear resin is subsequently refined through surface polishing and lacquer coating. Remember the lacquer coating (https://www.spraymax.com/en-us/products/product/clear-coats-and-spot-blender/2k-clear-glamour/) is extremely poisonous and need carefully personal protection.
   The CAD file will be released later.   

2. **Silicone Fabrication**   
  We use the same materials in our previous work GelTip, i.e., XP-565 from Silicones, Inc. (High Point, NC, USA) and Slacker from Smooth-on Company.
  After extensive experiments we found the best ratios to be 1:15:15, i.e., 1 gram of XP-565 part A, 15 grams of XP-565 part B and 15 grams of the Slacker. 
  The elastomer is fabricated through moulding with a two-piece mould, as shown in Fig. 1.

3. **Coated Layer Fabrication**  
   Mixing XP565 with NOVOCS solvent, aluminium powder, and Silver Bullet powder.
   Aluminium powder with reflective pigment was used for coatings. Specifically, the optimal ratio for the coating mixture is 1:15:4:4:10, i.e., 1 gram of XP-565 part A, 15 grams of XP-565 part B, 4 grams of aluminium powder, 4 grams of Silver Cast MagicÂ® from the Smooth-on Company, and 10 grams of NOVOCS Matte Solvent. Then the cured silicone base was dipped into this mixture to form the opaque reflective coating layer.

4. **Assembled Fingertip**  
   Final assembly of the fingertip using the fabricated components.

I have been very busy recently and will consider putting more details later. If you have any questions, just email me(jiaqi.jiang@bit.edu.cn). I will respond to you when I am available.
